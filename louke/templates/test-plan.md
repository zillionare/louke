# {Feature Title} — Test Plan

- **Spec ID**: {SPEC-ID}
- **Created**: {YYYY-MM-DD}
- **Related acceptance**: `.louke/project/specs/{SPEC-ID}/acceptance.md`
- **Related interfaces**: `.louke/project/specs/{SPEC-ID}/interfaces.md` (assertion basis — see §6.5)

## 1. Stance and Boundaries

### 1.1. Black-box Statement

This test plan only declares test methods that are **observable from outside the system**. Observable objects are limited to:

- Exposed external API / SDK interfaces
- Web service / CLI endpoints
- UI entry points (test **observed** behavior, not verify rendering)
- Structured log entries
- Persisted data files (JSON/parquet/...)
- Database tables

### 1.2. Non-observable Objects (tests do not directly depend on)

- Internal class hierarchies, scheduling state machines
- Intermediate data structures
- Implementation details (internal queues, registries, state variables)

> **Observable contract**: Any internal state that acceptance validation needs must be provided by the implementation layer via dump/log/DB observation points. This is the responsibility of **interfaces.md** — if an AC needs to observe internal state, interfaces.md must have a corresponding outlet (see §6.5).

### 1.3. Cheating Patterns (CI enforced interception)

| #   | Cheating Pattern                | Typical Symptom                                |
| --- | -------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------- |
| 1   | Change assertions to fit impl    | spec says "throw exception", test changes to "return False" |
| 2   | Use skip to evade validation     | `pytest.skip("see e2e")` but e2e is never written |
| 3   | Assertion degradation            | `assert issubclass(X, Exception)` instead of actually submitting and catching |
| 4   | try/except: pass                 | Exception path is swallowed                     |
| 5   | Over-mocking                     | Mock the framework core, testing mock behavior instead |
| 6   | Ground truth uses impl           | Expected value = impl output                   |
| 7   | Hardcoded expected values        | `assert result == 0.15` only because current impl outputs 0.15 |
| 8   | Trivial pass                     | `assert True` / `assert 1 == 1`                |

### 1.4. Safeguards (CI checks + PR process)

1. **AC mandatory tracing**
   - The first line of each test function's docstring/comment must contain `AC-FRXXXX-YY` (4-digit FR number + 2-digit AC number)
   - CI scans `tests/`, verifying: each test references at least one AC; each AC is referenced by at least one test
   - Any check failure blocks merge

2. **Assertion taboos** (CI static checks, violations block merge)
   - No `assert True` / `assert 1` / `assert <obj> is not None` as the sole assertion
   - No `try: ... except: pass` wrapping the code under test
   - No `pytest.skip(...)` / `@pytest.mark.skip` without a GitHub issue link

3. **Test change classification** (required in PR description)
   - [ ] New AC (link to acceptance.md commit)
   - [ ] Spec change (link to spec commit)
   - [ ] Fix flake / environment issue (link to issue)

   **Prohibited category**: "impl behavior inconsistent with spec → change test". Reject directly during review.

4. **Testability fallback** (if an AC cannot be tested)
   - Do not mock internals to force it through
   - Register it as a framework-side testability requirement, requesting the implementation layer to add a public assembly point
   - Until resolved, mark the AC as "blocked by testability gap"

### 1.5. Test Division of Labor

- **Unit tests / Integration tests**: Written by the **implementer** of the feature (committed alongside impl)
- **E2E tests**: Written by the **test lead** or dedicated test engineer
- **Ground Truth (§3)**: Provided by an **independent developer** not involved in the implementation under test, or a **third-party library**
- **Review ownership**: All test changes are reviewed by the test lead; Ground Truth script changes require focused review of semantic consistency with the corresponding AC

## 2. Test Environment

### 2.1. Directory Layout (recommended)

```
tests/
├── unit/          # Unit tests; mirror source file directory structure
├── e2e/           # End-to-end scenario tests
├── assets/        # Offline, reproducible test data
└── ground_truth/  # Optional: pure/reference implementation; must not import the system under test (see §3.2)
```

> - Unit tests and E2E use different data (separated by time/scenario) to prevent overfitting
> - E2E **must not** mock internal framework implementation (if mocking is necessary, the AC should be rewritten)
> - E2E **must not** depend on framework private APIs

### 2.2. Naming Conventions

- File: `test_<scenario>__<subscenario>.py`
- Function: `test_ac_<id>_<subscenario>`, e.g. `test_ac_020_08_empty_directory`

### 2.3. Execution

- **Offline**: Tests do not depend on network (data is pinned)
- **Execution order**: unit (fast) → integration → e2e (slow)
- **CI**: Run the full suite on every push
- **Isolation**: E2E uses a dedicated marker (e.g. `@pytest.mark.e2e`) to avoid mixing with unit tests

### 2.4. Test Data (project optional)

> **When needed**: Required when the project has external data dependencies (historical data, third-party APIs, hardware input, etc.); pure algorithm / pure internal logic may omit.

- **Source**: Built-in / remote API fetch / synthetic generation
- **Reproducible**: Each CI run should produce consistent results
- **Small data in-repo**: Recommend `tests/assets/`
- **Sensitive data**: Must not be committed; must be mocked or use synthetic data
- **Version snapshot** (if applicable): Use a manifest to record data version and generation time; CI validates the manifest

---

## 3. Ground Truth Method

> **When needed**: Required when the project has "algorithm correctness / rule correctness / computation result correctness" to verify (financial computation, rule engines, parsers, serialization, etc.); pure CRUD / UI rendering may omit.

### 3.1. General Principle

**Do not hardcode expected values**. All ground truth is computed by **independent sources** at test runtime:

| Type                                                       | Independent Source                             |
| ---------------------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------- |
| Algorithm correctness (intersection, trigger, matching, constraints) | **Manual calculation**: Write explicit small scripts |
| Evaluation metrics (Sharpe / win rate / annualized, etc.) | **Third-party library** (the project's chosen metrics library) |
| Simple rules (is it a holiday, does it satisfy a condition) | **The data itself**: Test dataset as the single source of truth |

> Key design: ground truth is a **recomputable script**, not a documented fixed value. At test runtime, the same data + ground truth script is called and compared with the framework output.

### 3.2. Ground Truth Isolation (mandatory rule)

To prevent circular validation where "expected value = output of the implementation under test" (§1.3 cheating pattern #6), ground truth scripts must satisfy:

1. **Code location**: All ground truth scripts are stored in the `tests/ground_truth/` directory (shared by unit/e2e)
2. **Import taboo**: `tests/ground_truth/**/*.py` **must not** `import {project}.*` (including submodules); CI static check blocks merge on violation
3. **Allowed dependencies**: Only standard library + test data files + agreed-upon third-party libraries (algorithm reference implementations)
4. **Data access**: Read data files directly from `tests/assets/*/fixtures/data/`, **not** through the framework's SDK
5. **Review ownership**: Ground truth script changes must be reviewed by the test lead; semantic consistency with the corresponding AC is the review focus

---

## 4. Test Scope

This test plan covers all requirements in spec.md in the same directory (and any other sibling spec documents it imports) where Valid / Testable / Decided are all green.

| Valid | Testable | Decided |
| ----- | -------- | ------- |
| ✅    | ✅       | ✅      |

---

## 5. Acceptance Criteria

1. Unit test coverage ≥95% (specific tooling depends on project language)
2. User scenarios in Stories and Spec are fully covered and pass
3. All FRs have corresponding test coverage (AC reference closure)
4. If §6 external dependency layered testing is enabled: L1/L2 pass by default in CI; L3 is runnable in the corresponding environment

---

## 6. External Dependency Layered Testing (project optional)

> **When needed**: Required when the project has external dependencies (databases, third-party APIs, hardware, real time, remote services, etc.); pure internal logic may omit.
>
> This section is an **extension of §1's black-box stance**: when the system interacts with the external world, how tests handle these external dependencies.

### 6.1. Three Unavoidable Constraints

| #   | Constraint                                | Consequence                                                |
| --- | ----------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------- |
| C1  | Test environment cannot connect to production dependencies | CI / cross-platform dev machines cannot run production paths |
| C2  | Cannot wait for real time                 | Cross-day / cross-week strategy cycle tests are infeasible  |
| C3  | Cannot mock framework internals           | Replacing/patching bypasses the behavior under test, violating the black-box stance |

> §2's offline data environment alone cannot make paths with external dependencies run — this section exists for that purpose.

### 6.2. Stance: Controllable vs Mock

- **Replace external dependencies** (controllable): Wall clock, external services, remote APIs, hardware — these are **external dependencies** of the framework under test and can be replaced with deterministic stand-ins
- **Cannot mock internal implementation**: The framework's own matching, scheduling, rules — these are **the object under test** and must not be mocked

> **Boundary iron rule**: Under no circumstances may you replace or bypass the framework's own critical implementation to "make the test pass". If a test finds it must bypass to pass, it means the AC's observability design is wrong; revise interfaces/acceptance instead of patching the test side.

### 6.3. Three-Layer Test Pyramid

Divided into three layers by fidelity/cost/speed. The ACs covered by each layer do not overlap; test markers strictly distinguish run timing.

| Layer | Name                | Time          | Speed  | Coverage               | Default Run       |
| ----- | ------------------- | ------------- | ------ | ---------------------- | ----------------- |
| L1    | Deterministic sim   | Virtual clock | Seconds | Most business ACs     | ✅ CI default     |
| L2    | Contract sim        | Virtual clock | Seconds | Protocol/interface contract ACs | ✅ CI default |
| L3    | Real env smoke      | Real calendar | Real   | Cross-mode run / minimal smoke | ❌ nightly/manual |

- **L1 Deterministic sim**: Replace "time advancement" and "external data sources" with deterministic stand-ins, running through several days of business cycles
- **L2 Contract sim**: Start a stand-in service that follows the same protocol (database/gateway/external API); the framework interacts with the stand-in
- **L3 Real env smoke**: Real calendar + real dependencies, single round-trip smoke (≤1 transaction); deselected by default, only runs in environments with real dependencies

> Any L3 test **must** be tagged with the corresponding marker (replacing the `pytest.skip` in §1.4); it must not evade L3 with a skip that has no issue link.

### 6.4. Responsibility Contract of Test Infrastructure

> Defines the **responsibilities + external observable boundaries** of stand-in components, for test engineers to implement. **Does not prescribe internal implementation details** (specific class names, method signatures are determined by the implementation layer).

| Component        | Responsibility (external)              | Boundary (what it does not implement) |
| ---------------- | --------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------- |
| Virtual clock    | Given "current time" + can fast-forward | Does not implement cross-day settlement logic |
| Data replay source | Feed pinned data as time advances    | Does not implement business rules      |
| Stand-in service | Implement external protocol            | Does not implement the framework's business |
| Orchestrator     | Assemble stand-ins + advance time      | Does not execute business on behalf of the framework |

### 6.5. Assertion Basis — Closure with interfaces.md

Test assertions **may only** land on the external observable outlets defined in **interfaces.md**:

- Database table schema
- API response fields
- Structured log entries
- File schema

> If a state needed by an AC has **no** corresponding observable outlet in interfaces.md, this is an observability gap; revise interfaces/acceptance to add the outlet, rather than snooping internal state in the test.
